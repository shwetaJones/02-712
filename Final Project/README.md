- Initialization scripts contain the classes that are used to simulate our object-oriented implementation of the SIR and SIRD models.
- Simulation scripts run varying combinations of parameters with correcsponding visualizations to understand the unique dynamics that dictate how SIR and SIRD models are impacted by social connectivity.
